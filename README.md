# Kannada-MSIT
## Kannada-MNIST Classification 🖼️

This repository contains a deep learning model for classifying Kannada-MNIST digits using TensorFlow and Keras.

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- TensorFlow
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Kannada-MNIST.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Kannada-MNIST
```

3. Run the script:
```bash
python kannada_mnist.py
```

## 📝 Code Explanation

The script follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**: Import necessary libraries and initialize the environment.
2. **Data Loading**: Load the Kannada-MNIST dataset.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize the images and reshape them for the model.
4. **Model Building**: Create a Sequential model with Conv2D, MaxPool2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout, and BatchNormalization layers.
5. **Model Compilation**: Compile the model with Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
6. **Model Training**: Train the model on the training data.
7. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on the validation data.
8. **Visualization**: Plot the training history and visualize sample predictions.

## 📊 Results

After training, the model achieves high accuracy on the validation set. The script includes visualization of the training process and sample predictions.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset can be found on Kaggle: [Kannada-MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/c/Kannada-MNIST).
